v1.0.0
------

29 May 2020

This is the first release of libosdp. It has been in pre-release for a
long time now and has been tested sufficiently well for a first release.
Rate of bug fixes has gone down significantly.

As of this release, libosdp has the following high level feature:
  - Supports OSDP CP mode of operation
  - Supports OSDP PD mode of operation
  - Supports Secure Channel for communication
  - Ships a tool: osdpctl to consume and library and setup/manage osdp
    devices
  - Documents key areas in the protocol that are of interest for consumers
    of this library.

So far, this library's CP implementation has been tested with multiple
OSDP PDs including HID's devices and found to be working as expected. The
PD implementation has been tested with it's own CP counterpart so this some
level of confidence on the that too.
