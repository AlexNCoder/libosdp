15 August 2020

This release marks the first HEAD of initial PD support in Zephyr RTOS upstream
(https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr). Lot of changes to coding style
were made to upstream the PD sources without too much variation to the one here.

Enhancements:

  - Produce source and binary tarballs with cPack
  - Bring changes from zephyr PD, post review and apply it to CP as well
  - Control the externally exposed library symbols using `EXPORT` macro

Fixes:
  - Make all internal methods static; scope all globals with `osdp_`
  - Add colors for various log levels of libosdp
  - Refactor all reference to struct osdp_pd as 'pd' everywhere
  - Fix static analysis issues identified by Xcode
  - travis: switch to Ubuntu 18.04 bionic for testing

This release bumps up the minor number as the contract has changed. It
introduces 2 major changes (first 2 in enhancements). The rest is all
re-organization and fixes.

    simplify API
  - Replace circular buffer command queue with linked list queue
  - Add SC status and status query methods
  - Add assert guards for exposed methods
  - Cleanup osdp.h by splitting it into multiple files
  - Split cmake rules into subdirectories

Fixes:
  - Add PD address to REPLY_COM in pd_build_reply
  - Fix fd leak in read_pid
  - Fix missing null char at atohstr()
  - Fix memory under-alloc due to operator precedence issues


v1.0.0
------

29 May 2020

This is the first release of libosdp. It has been in pre-release for a
long time now and has been tested sufficiently well for a first release.
Rate of bug fixes has gone down significantly.

As of this release, libosdp has the following high level feature:
  - Supports OSDP CP mode of operation
  - Supports OSDP PD mode of operation
  - Supports Secure Channel for communication
  - Ships a tool: osdpctl to consume and library and setup/manage osdp
    devices
  - Documents key areas in the protocol that are of interest for consumers
    of this library.

So far, this library's CP implementation has been tested with multiple
OSDP PDs including HID's devices and found to be working as expected. The
PD implementation has been tested with it's own CP counterpart so this some
level of confidence on the that too.
